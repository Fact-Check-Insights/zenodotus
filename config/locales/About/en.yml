    who_are_we: "Who are we, in fact?"
    mediavault_introduction: "MediaVault is a global collaborative archive designed to help journalists, fact-checkers, and researchers identify, document, and analyze manipulated visual content. Now powered by Fundación Maldita.es and Full Fact, the platform strengthens the fight against disinformation by preserving images and videos that circulate online before they disappear from social media, both through automatic collection of URLs from MediaReview tagging data, as well as user-submitted URLs."
    new_phase_mediavault_expands: "In this new phase, MediaVault expands its reach and capabilities to keep pace with the rapid evolution of visual disinformation. The platform enables experts to verify content more efficiently, cross-reference previously debunked images, and detect emerging patterns across international contexts. It also serves as a shared infrastructure for collaboration and research, powered by contributions from an international network of nearly 500 fact-checkers."
    content_property_of_users: "To reinforce transparency and trust, and understanding the value of the knowledge within the counter disinformation ecosystem, now all content added to MediaVault remains the property of its users. MediaVault simply provides the infrastructure and guidelines to archive the content in a secure way and it does not assume ownership of the materials stored by users."
    commitment_to_innovation: "By remaining free to access for fact-checkers, journalists, technologists, and researchers, MediaVault reinforces the commitment of Fundación Maldita.es and Full Fact to technological innovation, cooperation, and the preservation of digital memory in an information environment increasingly shaped by manipulation."
    original_developed_by_duke_reporters_lab: "MediaVault was originally developed in 2023 by Duke’s Reporters’ Lab and in 2025 it was transferred to two leading fact-checking organizations: Fundación Maldita.es, based in Spain, and Full Fact, based in the United Kingdom."
